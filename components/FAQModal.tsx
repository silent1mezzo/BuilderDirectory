            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We wanted to better understand what is being done in key areas that matter to Canadians like us. We built this tracker to know what key commitments have been made, what their progress has been, and how they impact outcomes.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Where do commitments come from?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We have pulled commitments from the Liberal Party's platform. We show the original text and the source in each commitment's details. As new commitments are made,we will add these in.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Where do metrics and targets come from?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              In cases where the Liberal Party has provided a metric and/or target, we use that. In other cases, we set a metric based on the policy's intention. In each graph, we show where the target source comes from.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How are the progress, impact, and alignment scores calculated?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We use an LLM to score each of these. We are planning to open source our prompts soon.
